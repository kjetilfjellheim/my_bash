#Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary
#Prefix with either
#- build
#- ci
#- docs
#- feat
#- fix
#- perf
#- refactor
#- test

#More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
#characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
#subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
#line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
#the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
#two together.

#Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
#or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
#by commands like git merge and git revert.

#Breaking changes:

#Resolves: #123
